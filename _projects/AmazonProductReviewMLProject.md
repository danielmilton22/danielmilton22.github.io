In this project, myself and three teammates used data from Amazon.com to predict the ratings of videogames. Through this process, I had to clean data, do exploratory data analysis, create a model, and reach a high accuracy in our prediction. We tried several models with the best performing being a logistic regression model with a F1-score of 0.6519.
