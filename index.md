Hi, I'm Daniel. I am an eager developer with a passion for creative problem solving and engineering. I like to challenge myself and love learning new skills. I am a tactful communicator and constructive collaborator with the ability to adapt to any situation.

Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities to use my background in machine learning and software development to solve real-world problems and expand my professional skill-set. 

When I'm not working on my programming skills, I love spending time outdoors, reading, weightlifting, and playing the piano.

Please take a look at my [Projects]{:.heading.flip-title} or my [Resume]{:.heading.flip-title}.

## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.

After you've familiarized yourself with Hydejack, you can delete the following folders and files
containing example content:
