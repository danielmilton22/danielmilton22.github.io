Hi, I'm Daniel. I am an eager developer with a passion for creative problem solving and engineering. I like to challenge myself and love learning new skills. I am a tactful communicator and constructive collaborator with the ability to adapt to any situation.

Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities to use my background in machine learning and software development to solve real-world problems and expand my professional skill-set. 

When I'm not working on my programming skills, I love spending time outdoors, reading, weightlifting, and playing the piano.

Please take a look at my [Projects]{:.heading.flip-title} or my [Resume]{:.heading.flip-title}.
